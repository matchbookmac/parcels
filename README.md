# `Parcel`

This library contains a `Parcel` class. The parcel object has the parameters, height, width, and length. Based on
these parameters, a user can calculate the cost to ship this parcel based on distance to ship, weight, and shipping
speed. Options such as a discount code can be provided, as well as the option to add gift wrap based on the surface
area of the parcel.
